## My process
  First, I assess all the possible div that are needed. Then used flex as a display property to ensure responsiveness. I followed all the color and did my best replicating the design.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3



### What I learned

I have learned the use of media query to customize the overall design on the specific viewport size.
